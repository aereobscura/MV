	<H1>About MORSEVIEW</H1>
	<p>
	MORSEVIEW is the personal project page of a goofy American individual who has developed a keen interest in the science of computing, programming, and other related fields.
	
	
	This page is, itself, a showcase of said goofy individual's skills and ability in web application design, development, and deployment. At current this project is in its infancy, even still in utero, however the intention is that this application will develop and change to reflect improvment of those and other skillsets over time, as the project expands. At current, this site will remain focused on computing topics related to 2 main branches, each with 2 sub branches:
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Branch 1:
			Linux system and network administration
				<ul>
					<li>
					Sub-Branch 1:
					Filesystem management and administration, bash shell scripting and interaction.
					</li>
					<li>
					Sub-Branch 2:
					Network management and administration, security, and ethical hacking.
					</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Branch 2:
			Python programming for general and robotics applications.
				<ul>
					<li>
					Sub-Branch 1:
					Application development for various use case scenerios, hardware configurations and functions.
					</li>
					<li>
					Sub-Branch 2:
					Custom circut hardware design and integration with Python and Raspberry Pi.
					</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	Eventually, this page may expand to include a larger project scope, but for now, please enjoy your time on MORSEVIEW.
